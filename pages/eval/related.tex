\section{Related Projects}

As there is a constant strive to find a way to thoroughly test and thereby eliminate the existence of bugs and unwanted behaviour, there are a myriad of papers, each proposing a solution to a subset of the overarching problem of badly written code.  In this section, we present a selection of these projects and what problem they try to solve.\\

This generated progress in how and when DSE can be used.
