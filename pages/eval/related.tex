As there is a constant strive to find a way to thoroughly test and thereby eliminate the existence of bugs and unwanted behaviour, there are a myriad of papers, each proposing a solution to a subset of the overarching problem of badly written code.  In this section, we present a selection of these projects and what problem they try to solve.\\

Tackling the path explosion of symbolic execution is a  major part of the recent research.
\citet{ryan_countering_nodate} try to alleviate this by introducing piece-wise composition, which passes the problem to the SMT solver as chunked independent trees of the complete execution tree, reducing the cost on the dynamic symbolic execution.
