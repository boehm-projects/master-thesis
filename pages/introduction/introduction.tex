This is a citation without name ~\cite{cadar_klee_nodate}.
As \citet{cha_unleashing_2012} point out, it also is a major challenge in the field of conformance testing.


In particular, this thesis makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define the problem of abc as an instance of xyz~(\autoref{chapter:content1}).
    \item We review the literature on xyz and show how corresponding solutions can be transferred to abc, following the example of def~(\autoref{chapter:content2}).
    \item We demonstrate how to encode a specific example of abc to WizWoz, an implementation of def~(\autoref{chapter:content3}), and confirm that it effectively solves the problem~(\autoref{chapter:evaluation}).
\end{itemize}


Testing of web applications for possible security breaches can be done in multiple ways. Most of them require extensive explicit writing of test cases, trying to catch all edge cases and hoping they would catch all potential threats. 

As the title of this thesis states, we used the dynamic symbolic execution (abbrev. DSE) engine ExpoSE, created and described in \citet{loring_expose_2017}

RQ1: Is it possible to reliably end-to-end fuzz test a web application using Dynamic Symbolic Execution in ExpoSE?\\
RQ2: Can it be used to reliably find security issues?
