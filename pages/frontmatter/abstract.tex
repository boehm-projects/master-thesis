\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis we present an approach to using ExpoSE, a dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) engine, for testing a web application for security issues and general bugs. We set out to answer the questions whether the engine could be used to test a web application in general and afterward whether it could be used to reliably discover any security issues related to cross-site scripting (XSS).
To explore the possibility, we implemented a plain JavaScript server and, after deeming it possible with the exclusion of the actual transmission of data between client and server, we created an Express.js model to test an existing server.
