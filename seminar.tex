\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The topic at hand is an important problem discussed several times in the recent literature~\cite{oakland23-xfl,spmag23-mlmalware,cryptosec11}. Industry requires a solution to this problem, as it is a major bottleneck in the development of new products~\cite{statemerging-patent}. As \citet{conformance-testing-arxiv} point out, it also is a major challenge in the field of conformance testing.

In particular, this article makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define the problem of abc as an instance of xyz~(\autoref{sec:phrasing}).
    \item We review the literature on xyz and show how corresponding solutions can be transferred to abc, following the example of def~(\autoref{sec:transfer}).
    \item We demonstrate how to encode a specific example of abc to WizWoz, an implementation of def~(\autoref{sec:remaining}), and confirm that it effectively solves the problem~(\autoref{sec:evaluation}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

We begin by introducing the background on university seminars~(\autoref{sec:seminars}), before reviewing the state of the art in measuring learning outcomes~(\autoref{sec:learning-outcomes}).

\autoref{fig:example-program} shows a simple example of a program. It is easy to see that the program is correct, as it returns the correct result.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\autoref{tab:results} shows the results of the evaluation. As can be seen, Method 1 outperforms Method 2. This is in line with the results of \citet{phdthesis-kinder}, who also found that Method 1 is superior to Method 2.
